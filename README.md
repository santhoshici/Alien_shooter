Ok so welcome to this page.
I'll give a short note on what all to setup before running my code. üóíÔ∏è</br>
&ensp;-> have all the files in same folder (can be change it if u know how to modify the code). </br>
&ensp;-> import the following modules</br>
   &emsp;=>Pygame (pip install pygame)</br>
   &emsp;=>mysql-connector-python (pip install mysql-connector-python)</br>
&ensp;-> have mysql setup in your computer and configure line 12-15 with the repective credentials</br>
&ensp;-> create the table using the code give in file.txt</br>
&ensp;->Line 25 and Line 26 has "Speed" and "Increaser" which should be modified with your respective computers. (really sorry for the inconvinience here. I'll try to solve it sooner)</br>
</br>
Yep I guess that explains brefily on all the setup to be done.</br>
</br>
Now steps to run</br>
  &ensp;-> at start just skip the uname and password which then asks u to type "C" to create a username</br>
  &ensp;-> type your username and password(case-sensitive)</br>
  NOTE: AVOID REPEATED USERNAMES</br>
  &ensp;-> now again type the username and password.</br>
  &ensp;-> you have 4 options which are actually just what it means. </br>
</br>
</br>
This game is just about shooting aliens. it starts slowly and then the spead increases according to the INCREASER variable</br>
</br>
</br>
Now that is all my code done</br>
HAVE FUN PLAYING </br>
