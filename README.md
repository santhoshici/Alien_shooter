Ok so welcome to this page.
I'll give a short note on what all to setup before running my code. 🗒️
 -> have all the files in same folder (can be change it if u know how to modify the code). 
 -> import the following modules
    =>Pygame (pip install pygame)
    =>mysql-connector-python (pip install mysql-connector-python)
 -> have mysql setup in your computer and configure line 12-15 with the repective credentials
 -> create the table using the code give in file.txt
 ->Line 25 and Line 26 has "Speed" and "Increaser" which should be modified with your respective computers. (really sorry for the inconvinience here. I'll try to solve it sooner)

Yep I guess that explains brefily on all the setup to be done.

Now steps to run
  -> at start just skip the uname and password which then asks u to type "C" to create a username
  -> type your username and password(case-sensitive)
  NOTE: AVOID REPEATED USERNAMES
  -> now again type the username and password.
  -> you have 4 options which are actually just what it means. 


This game is just about shooting aliens. it starts slowly and then the spead increases according to the INCREASE variable


Now that is all my code done
HAVE FUN PLAYING 
😊
